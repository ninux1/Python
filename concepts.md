1) Sets in Python cannnot be indexed OR operated upon however anding,oring like oprations can be done on 2 sets

2) __class__ gives the class namespace and not an attribute of the instance of the class. Also the class attributes are different from the class object attributes, other way, assigning the attribute of an object with the same name as an attribute of the class shadows the attribute on the class.
